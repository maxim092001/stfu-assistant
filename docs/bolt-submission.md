## Inspiration

We've all been there - that moment in a meeting when you realize you've just said something you shouldn't have. Whether it's accidentally revealing confidential information, making an inappropriate comment, or stepping into sensitive territory, these verbal missteps can have serious consequences for careers and relationships.

Even during presentations at hackathons, one of the speakers stopped herself because "I was about to drop a very bad word".

The inspiration for STFU Assistant came from recognizing that while everyone tells you what to do, nobody tells you what NOT to do in real-time when it matters most.

## What it does

STFU Assistant is a real-time conversation monitoring system that acts as your invisible wingman during meetings and calls. The system:

- Continuously listens to ongoing conversations in real-time
- Analyzes speech patterns and content for potential risks
- Provides immediate visual notifications through a beautiful, responsive UI as well as messenger notifications
- Offers different warnings from gentle cautions to urgent alerts
- Helps users navigate sensitive discussions without career-damaging mistakes

The warning is based on "risk" level, so users can:

- Risk 10-25: Gentle reminder that you're entering sensitive territory
- Risk 25-50: Warning that you've said something questionable but can continue
- Risk 50-75: Alert that you need to de-escalate and clarify your meaning
- Risk 75-100: Critical stop signal for potentially career-ending statements

## How we built it
The STFU Assistant was built using a combination of top-notch technologies:

- Speech Recognition: Real-time audio processing to convert speech to text via ElevenLabs
- Multi-agentic: Multi-agent Conversational AI workflow in ElevenLabs to perform multiple levels of pattern recognition
- Conversational context: By using ElevenLabs we make sure that all Agents are aware of conversation and can make weighted decisions
- Notification System: Beautiful, responsive UI generated with bolt.new and then fine-tuned with Claude. Integration with messengers for free!
- Multi-level Alert Framework: Graduated warning system for different risk levels

## Challenges we ran into

- Real-time Processing: Achieving good enough real-time low-latency speech recognition and analysis while maintaining accuracy
- Risk Sharing: Building a multi-agent workflow to be able to share risk information between multiple agents
- False Positive Management: Balancing sensitivity to avoid both missed warnings and unnecessary alerts
- Notifications: Creating notifications that are noticeable but not disruptive to natural conversation flow

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Succesfully implemented sophisticated multi-agent workflow with conversational sharing
- Created a multi-level risk-based warning system that adapts to different scenarios
- Developed an intuitive and beautiful notification interface that doesn't interrupt conversation flow
- Integrated with popular messenger to send same kind of notificatins to mobile/watch
- Established a foundation for future audio-based warning systems via ElevenLabs

## What we learned

- Complexity of context sharing between agents: Managing information flow and coordination between multiple AI agents proved more challenging than anticipated
- Reality check of how real-time things are actually real-time: Especially with voice to text processing, achieving true real-time performance has significant technical constraints
- User experience is crucial for adoption: Warnings must be helpful, not annoying - the balance between effectiveness and user-friendliness is critical
- The potential impact of AI-assisted communication tools: On professional interactions, person-to-person communication, and ways to help people stop making mistakes is enormous

## What's next for STFU Assistant

### Immediate Roadmap:

- Audio Notifications (v2.0): Integration with ElevenLabs text-to-speech for discreet audio warnings delivered through headphones. Currently we turned off that feature for the sake of better demo, but this is the next obvious step.
- Enhanced Real-time Processing: Improve system architecture to handle more fluid conversation flow and continuous monitoring capabilities
- Integration Capabilities: Support for popular video conferencing platforms (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) to capture sound directly from these applications

### Future Vision:

- Non-verbal Monitoring: Expand beyond speech to capture facial expressions and body language, preventing inappropriate non-verbal communication
- Personalized Learning: AI that adapts to individual communication styles and industry-specific terminology
- Industry-Specific Models: Specialized versions for legal, medical, financial, and other regulated industries
