STFU assistant

Context: give assistant initial context information about meeting and what is planning to happen

During meeting: listen to what is happening, what you are saying and what person is saying. Generate warnings if you are about to share confidential information via notification.

Advise: generate text notification. UI should be very beautiful and very responsive. Different levels of warnings such as:

- you need to be careful as you are currently in a sensitive area discussion.
- you did say wrong word, don't do it going forward, but also don't stop.
- you said something bad, try to de-escalate explain what you meant
- you said something VERY WRONG. Stop yourself, de-escalate and never do that again.

Advise v2.0: instead of text notification, audio via headphone to someones year via elevenlabs text-to-speach
