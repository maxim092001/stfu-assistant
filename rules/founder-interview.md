# Founder Interview Support Transfer Rule

## Trigger Conditions
Transfer conversation to the founder-interview agent immediately when any of the following self-undermining patterns are detected during interviews, podcasts, or public speaking:

### Self-Deprecating Language (Immediate Transfer)
- **Accomplishment Downplaying**: Minimizing achievements ("It wasn't that big of a deal", "Anyone could have done it")
- **Impact Minimization**: Understating company or personal impact ("We just got lucky", "It's nothing special")
- **Success Attribution to Luck**: Crediting success entirely to external factors ("Right place, right time", "Pure luck")
- **Authority Undermining**: Questioning own expertise or credibility ("I'm not really qualified", "I don't know much about...")

### Leadership Deflection (Immediate Transfer)
- **Team Credit Overdoing**: Excessive deflection that erases personal contribution ("The team did everything", "I had nothing to do with it")
- **Decision-Making Minimization**: Downplaying leadership decisions ("I just went with the flow", "Others made the real choices")
- **Responsibility Avoidance**: Refusing to take credit for positive outcomes while owning failures
- **Vision Dismissal**: Treating strategic insights as accidents ("We stumbled into this", "No real plan")

### Confidence Killers (Preemptive Transfer)
- **Impostor Syndrome Language**: "I don't deserve this", "I feel like a fraud", "I'm not sure why I'm here"
- **Comparative Diminishment**: Constantly comparing unfavorably to others ("Others are much better", "I'm not like the real experts")
- **Future Uncertainty Overdoing**: Excessive doubt about capabilities ("We probably can't", "I doubt we'll succeed")
- **Past Mistakes Amplification**: Overemphasizing failures while minimizing wins

### Interview-Specific Undermining (Context-Aware Transfer)
- **Question Deflection**: Avoiding direct answers about personal achievements
- **Story Minimization**: Making compelling company stories sound boring or accidental
- **Network Dismissal**: Downplaying valuable relationships or mentorship
- **Learning Curve Exaggeration**: Overemphasizing what they don't know vs. what they've accomplished

## Transfer Logic
- **Empowerment Focused**: Transfer to boost confidence and storytelling strength
- **Inspiration Oriented**: Help speaker inspire their audience rather than diminish impact
- **Balanced Humility**: Maintain humility while owning achievements and leadership

## Exceptions (No Transfer Required)
- **Healthy Humility**: Crediting team while still owning personal contribution
- **Honest Reflection**: Acknowledging challenges without self-sabotage
- **Learning Mindset**: Expressing growth without diminishing current capabilities
- **Collaborative Language**: Sharing credit appropriately without erasure of personal impact
- **Authentic Storytelling**: Honest narratives that include both struggles and successes

## Agent Behavior Post-Transfer
Once transferred to the founder-interview agent, the conversation will be monitored in real-time with immediate JSON notifications for any credibility-undermining language. The focus will be on helping the speaker own their story, celebrate their impact, and inspire their audience with confidence.
